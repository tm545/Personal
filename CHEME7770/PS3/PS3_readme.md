Matrices.jl shows the Stoichiometrix matrix, the atom matrix, the bounds matrices for both the fluxes and metabolite steady state concentrations.

Derivations of upper bound fluxes are shown this file additionally.

Running the Matrices.jl file will output the first 6 columns of the E matrix (A x S) to show the balancing of the reactions around the arginine biosynthesis pathway, in addition to the flux of urea out of the system.
