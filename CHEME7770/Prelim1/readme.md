Prelim problems are distributed through julia files. Problem2_attemp2.jl creates a data dictionary and plots the protein concentrations. Problem22.jl uses data from the GRNSimKit run from Problem2_attemp2.jl but otherwise builds its own reaction rates instead of accessing the data dictionary from GRNSimKit to answer problems 2b and 2c with the final scaled matrices being printed by the file. Problem 3 creates the stoichiometric matrix and utilizes the Flux.jl file to use GLPK functions and answer question 3, the semi log plot of inducer to protein translation rate is immediately produced as well as the change in rates by alteration of the exchange fluxes.
